# Revette-3D
Revette, but now in 3D. This is a (simple?) project that I am developing to learn about 3D voxel generation, and it is the successor to the previous "Revette" which was pretty much the same thing but in 2D.

At this point (like myself) you may be wondering, why voxels? And the sole reason for this is that I kind of don't want to work with models more complex than well, rectangles. And so from this line of thinking: Revette (now in 3D) was born.
